  1. Introduction
  ---------------
    DOSINFO gives information about dos version, current date and time,
    graphic drive, BREAK and VERIFY settings, environment variables,
    free conventional memory, hard disk sizes and free spaces.

    The program runs on any IBM PC or compatible computer, under
    MS-DOS 3.30 or newer operating system.
    It needs about 40 kbytes of free (conventional) memory.

  2. Legal Notice
  ---------------
    This program is being distributed as FREEWARE. It means that you may use
    the program free of charge.

    The distribution files are:
        FILE_ID .DIZ     Short program description
        DOSINFO .DOC     Program documentation
        DOSINFO .EXE     DOSINFO v1.3 executable program

    The program package, which MUST include all the above files may be freely
    copied and distributed. These files may be re-archived to better suit a
    given distribution system, but the files may not be modified in any other
    way. No distributor may charge more than $5 for the distribution of this
    program. Uploading to BBSs or FTP sites or distribution on CD-ROMs are
    accepted and encouraged.

  3. Usage
  --------
    If you start the program with /h or /? as argument you will get a brief
    help about the available options.
    Options can be given preceded by / or -
    Lower and upper case letters mean the same.
    Multiple options can be given in a line. Each group of options must start
    with a / or - and must not contain spaces. The groups must be separated
    by one or more spaces. The /s, /f and /c options must be last ones in a
    group, the best is to give them separately.

    Options are:

    /h , /?       shows this help screen
    /v            DOS version
    /e            list of environment variables
    /k            settings of DOS-switches ( BREAK, VERIFY )
    /d            current date
    /t            current time
    /m            free conventional memory
    /g            graphic driver and current mode
    /s[drive]     total space on drive
    /f[drive]     free space on drive
    /c[drive]     current directory on drive
    /a            size information about all hard drives

    If you use /s, /f or /c without a drive letter, the current drive will be
    selected.
    If no option is given, DOSINFO uses "/vdtkgmc /a".
    If you specify a filename, the output will be generated in this file,
    not on the screen. The default extension is .TXT
    Note: If given, the name of the output file must preceed all other options.

    Examples:
      DOSINFO             info about everything except environment variables
      DOSINFO /?          get help
      DOSINFO report -dT  current date and time in REPORT.TXT
      DOSINFO /MS /f -c   free memory, current directory, total space and free
                            space on current drive
      DOSINFO /SA /FA     total space and free space on drive A:
      DOSINFO hd.lst /A   total space and free space on all hard drives in
                            the file HD.LST
