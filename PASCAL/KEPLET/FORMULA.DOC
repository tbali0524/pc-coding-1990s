  1. Introduction
  ---------------
    FORMULA is a Mathemathical Expression Evaluating Program with
    about 100 - 100 built-in contants and functions, and a
    constant and function editor, where you can define and save your own set.

    The program runs on any IBM PC or compatible computer, under
    MS-DOS 3.30 or newer operating system.
    The program also runs as a DOS application under Windows 95/98/ME/NT
    but not under Windows XP as it has no DOS support.
    It needs about 160 kbytes of free (conventional) memory.

    The package is being distributed as FREEWARE.

    To start the program type FORMULA and press enter. (If it is in the
    current directory or in a directory listed in the PATH environmental
    variable. Otherwise specify full pathname before the programname.)

    The main screen of the program appears. In the upper left corner
    you can see the constants panel, in the upper right corner the program
    title and copyright information. The functions panel is on the lower
    half of the screen. Above that there is an expression line, where you
    can type in an expression to evaluate.

    A SIMPLE SESSION:
    - Type a simple expression, e.g.: 1/sin(pi/4) and press enter. The result
      of evaluation (1.4142135624E+00) appears above the expression.
    - To load the mathemathical definitions, press F3 then Y (confirmation).
      Type in the name of the definition file (MATH.DEF) and press Enter.
      After the O.K. message, press Enter and the new constants and functions
      will be available on the panels.
    - To browse the functions, press the Tab key until the cursor is blinking
      in the functions panel. Now press Page Up/Down as you like.
    - To get further help, press F1 and then Page Up/Down to browse.
      (This online help contains also the list of standard definition files.)
    - To quit press Esc or Alt-X and answer Y (Yes) to the confirmating
      question.

  2. Entering a Formula
  ---------------------
    You can enter a formula in the expression line. Type any numbers or
    letters, they will appear in the line. Use the left and right arrow keys
    to move the cursor, Backspace to erase the previous character, Del to
    erase the character under the cursor and Alt-R to erase the whole line.
    Press Home to jump to the beginning of the line or End to jump after the
    last character.
    The Ins key changes between Insert and Overwrite modes.
    At program start the line-editor is in Insert mode. It means, if you
    enter a new character, it will be inserted in the line. In overwrite
    mode the new character replaces the old one under the cursor.
    After entering the formula, press Enter to evaluate it. The result will
    appear above the expression, on the right side of the screen.
    If the expression is not correct, an error line appears. Then press Enter
    to accept it and continue editing the expression.
    You can copy the result of the evaluation in the constants panel with
    Alt-K.

  3. Expression Syntax
  --------------------
    Expressions must be entered as a string, much like if you would write
    them on a paper. (But the sign of division and power is other.)

    You can use:
      - Numbers (in scientific form (e.g. -3.45E+18) or short form (e.g. -3) )
      - Basic operators ( + , - , * , / ) (Sign of multiply is not necessary)
      - Power (e.g. 45^3 ) ( Base must be non-negative )
      - Parentheses nested in any depth
      - Constant identifiers (built-in or defined constants)
      - Function calls (built-in or defined functions)
          Passing arguments:
            - List of the arguments separated by comma in parenthesis
            - Argument can be any expression
            - At functions with one argument the parenthesis can be left out
                when there isn't any oparator in the argument ( e.g. sin pi )
    Operator precedence is as in mathemathics usual:
      - parentheses, function calls, power, multiply/divide, add/subtract
    Spaces can be inserted or omitted. (But there are some exceptions.)

    Built-in functions: (all with one argument)
     ABS       absolute value
     ARCTAN    arcustangent (in radians!)
     COS       cosine (anle in radians!)
     EXP       e raised to the x-th power (e = 2.718281...)
     FACT      factorial (0 <= x <= 33; x is integer)
     LN        natural logarithm (x > 0)
     INT       integer part
     SIN       sine (anle in radians!)
     SGN       sign (1 if x > 0; 0 if x = 0; -1 if x < 0)
     SQRT      square root (x >= 0)
    Built-in constant:
     PI ( 3.1415926535 )

    The built-in functions and the PI are always available.
    Other constants are in the standard definition libraries.

    Example expression: 2 PI SIN E + 2(ABS(ROOT2(1,  2*2,INT(1.3)))^2 - 2.1E-2)

  4. Editing and Viewing the Function List
  ----------------------------------------
    Press the Tab key repeatedly until the cursor is blinking in the functions
    panel (lower part of the screen).
    Each row represents one function. The first column is the function name,
    the second is the number of arguments and the third is the definition
    itself. Use the arrow keys to move the cursor and edit the contents by
    typing. These are the keys with special meaning:
      Arrows  . . . . . .  Move cursor
      Ctrl Left / Right .  Jump to next previous cell
      Enter . . . . . . .  Jump to next cell
      Page Up / Down  . .  Show next / previous page
      Home / End  . . . .  Jump to beginning / end of cell
      Ctrl Home / End . .  Jump to first / last cell in the line
      Ctrl Page Up / Down  Jump to beginning / end of table
      BackSpace . . . . .  Erase previous character
      Del . . . . . . . .  Erase the character under the cursor
      Ins . . . . . . . .  Change Insert / Overwrite mode
      Alt R . . . . . . .  Clear cell
      Alt S . . . . . . .  Clear line
      Alt Y . . . . . . .  Delete line (extract from table)
      Alt T . . . . . . .  Delete table
      Alt N . . . . . . .  Insert empty line
      Alt M . . . . . . .  Copy the cell above to this cell
      Alt W . . . . . . .  Copy line - specify source line
      Alt V . . . . . . .  Copy line - specify target line

    To add your own function:
    - Move the cursor to an empty line (to the end of the list)
    - Enter the name of the function in the first column
    - Enter the number of arguments in the second column (1 can be omitted)
    - Enter the defining formula in the third column as a regular expression
        - Argument names are X1, X2, ... X9
            (At functions with one argument, X can be used.)
        - You can call any built-in or user-defined functions, but avoid
             recursive calls. (It causes endless loop.)
    The names of constants and functions must start with a letter.
    The program doesn't check for multiple used names.

  5. Editing and Viewing the Constant List
  ----------------------------------------
    The constants panel works very similar to the functions panel. Use the
    same keys to move the cursor or to edit the cells.
    Each row represents one constant. The first column is the constant name,
    the second is its value in scientific notation.

    To add your own constant:
    - Enter the name of the constant in the first column, its value in the
      second
    - If the value is a result of computing:
        - Enter the appropriate expression in the Expression cell
        - Press the Alt K
           (The result appears at the end of the constants list)
        - Give a name to the new constant

  6. Saving, Loading and Appending Definitions
  --------------------------------------------
    Press the F2 key in any panel to save all constant and function definitions
    in panels. When prompted, give a valid filename and press Enter.
    The suggested extension is .DEF but it is not mandatory and will not
    added if no extension is given. The definitions will be saved in a special
    ASCII file under the given name. The filename STARTUP.DEF is somewhat
    special: This file is automatically loaded when FORMULA starts. So save
    your frequently used definitions with this name.
    With the F3 key you can load the your previously saved definitions or any
    of the predefined standard libraries.
    Answer Yes with Y to the confirmation question, give the filename
    (with the full path if not in the default directory) and press Enter.
    Warning! All unsaved definitions in the editor will be lost.
    With F4 you can append the contents of a definition file to the list
    of definitions currently in the editor. The program doesn't check for
    multiple used names.

  7. The Available Standard Definition Libraries
  ---------------------------------------------
    Many constants and function are in definition libraries. These libraries
    can be edited. The standard libraries are:
     MATH    .DEF     Mathemathical constants and functions
     PHYSICS .DEF     Physical and SI constants and functions
     MEASURE .DEF     Non-SI units of measurement - constants and functions
    All constants and functions in these libraries are described in the online
    help. Just press Alt-F1 and then Page Up/Down to browse.
    To use any of these constants or functions, load the appropriate library
    with F3 or F4.

  8. Getting Online Help
  ----------------------
    Press F1 in any panel to get online help. The help is several pages
    in length, so use the Page Up/Down keys to browse. At the end of the
    help there is a short description of every functions and constants in
    the standard definition libraries. Press Alt-F1 instead of F1 to jump
    directly to them. Press Esc to exit help.
    The help text is in a special ASCII file called FORMULA.HLP. You can edit
    this file to add descriptions of your own functions. See FORMULA.HLP for
    details.
