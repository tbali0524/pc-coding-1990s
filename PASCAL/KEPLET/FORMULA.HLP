At startup the program loads the STARTUP.DEF definition file (if it exists),
so save in this file the definitions you use frequently.
If you specify a definition file name in command line argument,
that file will be loaded.

To print the definitions, enter PRN as filename after hitting F2.

Expression syntax
-----------------
 Expressions must be entered as a string, much like if you would write them
 on a paper. (But the sign of division and power is other.)

 You can use:
   - Numbers (in scientific form (e.g. -3.45E+18) or short form (e.g. -3) )
   - Basic operators ( + , - , * , / ) (Sign of multiply is not necessary)
   - Power (e.g. 45^3 ) ( Base must be non-negative )
   - Parentheses nested at any depth
   - Constant identifiers (built-in or defined constants)
   - Function calls (built-in or defined functions)
       Passing arguments:
         - List of the arguments separated by comma in parenthesis
         - Argument can be any expression
         - At functions with one argument the parenthesis can be left out
             when there isn't any oparator in the argument ( e.g. sin pi )
 Operator precedence is as in mathemathics usual:
   - parentheses, function calls, power, multiply/divide, add/subtract
 Spaces can be inserted or omitted. (But there are some exceptions.)

 Example expression: 2 PI SIN E + 2(ABS(ROOT2(1,  2*2,INT(1.3)))^2 - 2.1E-2)
[Screen 04:]
User-defined constants:
-----------------------
 - Enter the name of the constant in the first column, its value in the second
 - If the value is a result of computing:
     - Enter the appropriate expression in the Expression cell
     - Press the Alt K
        (The result appears at the end of the constants list)
     - Give a name to the new constant

User-defined functions:
-----------------------
 - Enter the name of the function in the first column
 - Enter the number of arguments in the second column (1 can be omitted)
 - Enter the defining formula in the third column as a regular expression
     - Argument names are X1, X2, ... X9
         (At functions with one argument, X can be used.)
     - You can call any built-in or user-defined functions, but avoid
          recursive calls. (It causes endless loop.)
     - You can use defined constants as well.

The names of constants and functions must start with a letter.
The program doesn't check for multiple used names.
[Screen 05:]
Operators:
----------
 +   -   *   /   ^   (Power only to positive base)
 Sign change: e.g. -x (Usually you should put it in parenthesis e.g. (-x)^2.5 )

Built-in functions: (all with one argument)
-------------------
 ABS       absolute value
 ARCTAN    arcustangent (in radians!)
 COS       cosine (anle in radians!)
 EXP       e raised to the x-th power (e = 2.718281...)

 LN        natural logarithm (x > 0)
 INT       integer part

 SGN       sign (1 if x > 0; 0 if x = 0; -1 if x < 0)
 SQRT      square root (x >= 0)

Built-in constant:
------------------
 PI ( 3.1415926535 )
