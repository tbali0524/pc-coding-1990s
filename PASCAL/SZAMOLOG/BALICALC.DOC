  1. Introduction
  ---------------
    BALI'S CALC is a simple scientific calculator program.

    The program runs on any IBM PC or compatible computer, under
    MS-DOS 3.30 or newer operating system. It needs about 40 kbytes of free
    (conventional) memory. The presence of a mouse can be helpful but not
    mandatory.
    The program also runs as a DOS application under Windows 95/98/ME/NT
    but not under Windows XP as it has no DOS support.

    The package is being distributed as FREEWARE.

    To start the program type BALICALC and press enter. (If it is in the
    current directory or in a directory listed in the PATH environmental
    variable. Otherwise specify full pathname before the programname.)
    On the left side of the screen a calculator (with display and buttons)
    appears, while on the right side you can see a short help about the
    program.
    To quit press Esc or Alt-X or Alt-Q.


  2. Pressing the "Buttons"
  -------------------------
    The cursor is blinking on the calculator's button panel. You can move
    the cursor above the "buttons" using the arrow keys, and the Home, End,
    Page Up and Page Down keys. If you press Enter, the current button
    will be pressed.
    Many buttons have a hotkey, so you can activate them by a single keypress
    on the computer's keyboard. These hotkeys are:
      < = BackSpace,    C = C,  A = AC,  E = EXP, S = SCI, M = Mem, \ = +/-,
      T = Tan, G = Lg,  L = Ln, R = Rad, D = Deg, ^ = xý,  û = ûx,  ! = x!,
      ü = xü,  # = Ran, P = Pi, = = = (This last one isn't a joke!)
    You can also use a mouse, if you have one. The left mouse-button activates
    a calculator's button (like Enter). The mouse-cursor, a red rectangle
    moves independently from the blinking (thin) cursor.
    If you press a calculator button (using any of these three methods),
    the blinking (keyboard) cursor will jump above that button.


  3. Entering Numbers
  -------------------
    Numbers can be given in scientific form (e.g. -1.234E-18) or shortly
    (e.g. 5). The sign can be toggled with +/- button. Use the EXP button
    to enter an exponent. If the exponent is positive then its sign can be
    left out (it appears automatically), if negative then use the - button.
    The < (BackSpace) button erases the last character (digit), the C button
    clears the whole display.
    The usable number range is about ñ1Eñ39, the computing accuracy is 9-10
    digit.
    Pi is a built in constant, it can be recalled anytime by pressing the
    appropriate (Pi) button.


  4. Operators with Two Arguments
  --------------------------------
    Beside the basic operators ( + - * / ) you can use n.-th power and root.
    By these last two, the exponent must be given after the operator and the
    base must be positive.
    The precedence is usual (as in the mathemathics):
        - power and root ( xü, üûx )
        - multiplication and division ( * / )
        - addition and subtraction ( + -)
    This order of computing can be changed by using parentheses.
    Parentheses can be embedded practically in any depth.


  5. Built-in Functions
  ---------------------
    Some basic functions are available:
        - Trigonometric functions (Sin, Cos, Tan)
            (Operand must be in radian. If you enter it in degrees, press
            the Rad button to convert)
        - Inverse trigonometric functions (ArcSin, ArcCos, ArcTan)
            (Notation on the buttons: -1)
            (The result is in radians)
        - Converting from degrees to radians (Rad)
        - Converting from radians to degrees (Deg)
        - Natural logarithm and exponential function (Ln, e^x)
        - Base ten logarithm and exponential (10^x) function (Lg, -1)
        - Factorial (x!)
        - Square (xý)
        - Square root (ûx)
        - Reciprocal (1/x)
        - Sign changing (+/-)
        - Random number between 0.000 and 0.999
            (By this function the operand is ignored)
    The operand is always the number on the display. If the operand is out
    of the function's input range, an "Arithmetic error!" message appears.
    In that case press the AC button to reset the calculator.
    The same error message appears, if an overflow occurs. (The valid
    number range is about ñ1Eñ39)
    (Note: by addition and subtraction the program may stop with a Runtime
    error message if an overflow occured. In this case simply restart the
    calculator program.)


  6. Memory
  ---------
    One number can be stored at one time. If the memory is not empty, an M
    can be seen on the upper left corner of the display.
    The memory manipulating buttons:
        - Mem : Stores the number on the display in the memory.
                  (If it is 0, it clears the memory.)
        - M+  : Adds the number on the display to the memory content and
                  store the result in the memory.
        - RM  : Shows the content of the memory on the screen.
    The C and the AC buttons don't clear the memory.


  7. Other Buttons
  ----------------
       =  : Executes the previous operation
      AC  : Resets the calculator
              (Display and previous operations are cleared)
      SCI : Toggles between normal and scientific notation
             - In "normal" mode numbers are displayed in the shortest form.
               Exponents are used only if number is less than 0.01 or
               greater than 10^9 (without signs)
             - In "scientific" mode the exponent is always displayed and
               the number of the decimal digits is constant.
               (In this mode "SCI" can be seen on the display.)
      ESC : Quits from program, returns to DOS.
