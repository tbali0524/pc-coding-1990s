  1. Introduction
  ---------------
    STEFI is a Graph Editor and Analyser Program
    You can edit, save, view graphs and analyse them. Report can be
    generated about many details, e.g. weights, matrices, components,
    Prufer code, min. cost path and tree, excentricity, center,
    topologic order, strong components, circles and more.

    The package is being distributed as FREEWARE.

    The program runs on any IBM PC or compatible computer, under
    MS-DOS 3.30 or newer operating system. It needs about 400 kbytes of free
    (conventional) memory. The presence of a mouse can be helpful but not
    mandatory.
    The program also runs as a DOS application under Windows 95/98/ME/NT
    but not under Windows XP as it has no DOS support.

  2. Legal and Distribution Information
  -------------------------------------
    This program is being distributed as FREEWARE. It means that you may use
    the program free of charge. However, if you insist to send donations, you
    may do so by sending the choosen amount to my address. (See at the end of
    this document.) Postcards are also kindly appreciated. Or just an email,
    saying that you use (or used) this software.

    The distribution files of the program package are:
        FILE_ID .DIZ     Short program description
        STEFI   .DOC     Program documentation/manual
        STEFI   .EXE     Stefi - the executable program itself
        STEFI   .TVH     Online binary helpfile (needed by STEFI.EXE)
        DAG     .GRF     Sample graph file
        DISTANCE.GRF     Sample graph file
        FOREST  .GRF     Sample graph file

        PRUFER  .GRF     Sample graph file
        STRONGC .GRF     Sample graph file

    The program package, which MUST include all the above files may be freely
    copied and distributed. These files may be re-archived to better suit a
    given distribution system, but the files may not be modified in any other
    way. No distributor may charge more than $5 for the distribution of this
    program. Uploading to BBSs or FTP sites or distribution on CD-ROMs are
    accepted and encouraged.

  3. Getting Started
  ------------------
    STEFI uses Turbo Vision as a user interface, what is well-known for its
    simple usage. On the top of the screen there is a menu bar. Click with the
    mouse on any item to access a pull-down menu and then click on a menu item
    to select it. You can also press F10 to access the menu bar and cursor
    keys and Enter to navigate.
    On the right side of the menu bar the filename of the currently opened
    graph can be seen (or <untitled> if it hasn't been saved yet).
    The bottom of the screen is the status bar which lists some of the
    available hotkeys or a short description of the highlighted menu item.
    The largest part of the screen (called desktop) is empty at startup. Later
    the results of a graph analysis appears here in a separate window. You
    can browse the result with the cursor keys, Page Up/Down or with the
    vertical scroll bar on the right side of the window. You may have several
    windows opened at the same time, you can move, resize or arrange them.

    To see quickly, how STEFI works, press F3 or select Open from the
    Graph menu. Select any saved graph (graph files have .GRF as extension)
    and click on Ok. Press F7 or select Graph|View to see the graph. Press
    any key to bring back the user interface then press F9 or select
    Graph|Report to analyse it. A dialog box appears where you can choose what
    information will be put in the report. The default is all available
    information. Click on Ok and the report will be displayed on the screen
    and saved to the disk at the same time. Now press F4 or select Graph|Edit
    to modify the graph and re-create the report.
    See the online documentation for more details about creating opening,
    viewing, editing, saving and analysing graphs, moving resizing, arranging
    windows, using dialog boxes, etc.

  4. How to Get Online Help
  -------------------------
    STEFI contains context-sensitive online help. To get help on any menu item
    or dialog box, simply press F1. A help screen appears describing the
    current menu item or dialog box.
    You can also access the help system via the Help menu. Choose the Contents
    menu item as a starting point. To get help on using the help system itself,
    choose the Help on Help menu item. Most of the help screens contains
    links to other help screen. To jump to the referenced screen, just click
    the portion of text with different color.
    Also note, when a menu item is highlighted, the status bar (at the bottom
    of the screen) gives a short description of that menu item.
    The graph editor has no help screen, but all valid key-kombination is
    listed on the left side of the screen.

  5. Constraints
  --------------
    Currently the program supports graphs only with a limited size. The
    upper limit of nodes is 26, mainly because it is convenient to label
    a node by a single letter. This limit could be increased (and possible
    will be increased in a future version) but I find it big enough for
    practical situations, because editing larger graphs and seeing analysis
    results of larger graphs are not easy.
    Only one edge is allowed between two nodes. (Or two in case of a directed
    graph: one in both directions.) No single loop (an edge with the same node
    as start and endpoint) is allowed.
    Here are the constraints:
        Maximum number of nodes: 26
        Maximum number of edges: 26 * 25 (The number of maximum possible edges
                                          in a full directed 26-node graph.)
        Maximum number of circles: 1000
        Maximum number of cuts: 1000
