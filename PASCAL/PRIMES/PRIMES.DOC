  1. Introduction
  ---------------
    PRIMES can generate the list of the prime numbers in a textfile.
    It can generate the prime factorization (e.g. 644 = 2 * 2 * 7 * 23 )
    of the numbers in another textfile. These textfiles can be printed
    or searched later by any ascii editor.
    The upper limit of the lists can be given. (Maximum is 60000)

    The program runs on any IBM PC or compatible computer, under
    MS-DOS 3.30 or newer operating system.
    The program also runs as a DOS application under Windows 95/98/ME/NT
    but not under Windows XP as it has no DOS support.
    It needs about 90 kbytes of free (conventional) memory.

  3. Usage
  --------
    If you start the program without arguments you will get a brief help
    about the available options.
    Options can be given preceded by / or -
    Lower and upper case letters mean the same.
    Multiple options can be given in a line separated by one or more spaces.
    The order of options is unsignificant.

    Options are:

    /?            shows this help
    /n:number     greatest examined number ( 1 < N < 60000 )  default is 1000
    /p            list of the prime numbers between 1 and N
                      to the file PRIMES.TXT
    /p:filename   same as /p but to the file "filename"
    /f            prime factorization of the numbers between 1 and N
                      to the file FACTOR.TXT
    /f:filename   same as /f but to the file "filename"

    Examples:
      PRIMES /P           writes the list of the prime numbers
                            between 1 and 1000 to the file PRIMES.TXT
      PRIMES /N:500 /F    writes the prime factorization of the numbers
                            between 1 and 500 to the file FACTOR.TXT
      PRIMES /P /F:F.TXT  writes the list of the prime numbers
                            between 1 and 1000 to the file PRIMES.TXT
                            and writes the prime factorization of the numbers
                            between 1 and 1000 to the file F.TXT

    If the given upper limit (/n option) is high, building the listfiles can
    take some time and the generated files are quite long.
    (PRIMES /N:60000 /P /F took less than 1 minute on a 486DX2/66 with a disk
    cache program and about 1.5 minutes without cache on the same machine.
    The generated FACTOR.TXT was about 1.4 megabytes.)
